  Proof of Care is the core consensus primitive of Bit Brains. It replaces
  extractive incentive models with demonstrated stewardship. Care actions
  are observable, attributable, and economically recognized through
  verifiable computation and zero-knowledge proof technologies.

        <h2>Brains & Brainiacs</h2>
        <p>
          Brains are autonomous intelligence artifacts owned by stewards.
          Brainiacs are maturation layers attached to Brains that enhance
          reward multipliers and long-term participation incentives through
          epoch-based progression.

      <section style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem" }}>
        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>
          Participants may contribute by staking, caring for Brains, or
          stewarding Brainiacs. Rewards are distributed according to
          canonical protocol rules and epoch-based evaluation.
