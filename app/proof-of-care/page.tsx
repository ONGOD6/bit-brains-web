      <p>
        Proof of Care (PoC) is the core consensus primitive of Bit Brains. It
        replaces extractive incentive models with demonstrated stewardship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Care is not claimed — it is observed, attributable, and verifiable.
        Actions that preserve, improve, or responsibly guide intelligent systems
        are recognized as first-class economic signals through verifiable
        computation and zero-knowledge proof technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proof of Care aligns intelligence, ownership, and responsibility into a
        single accountable system.
      </p>

        <h2>What Is Bit Brains</h2>
        <p>
          Bit Brains is a protocol for stewarded intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          It enables the creation, ownership, and evolution of autonomous
          intelligence artifacts (“Brains”) that are guided by human stewards
          rather than exploited as disposable compute. The system rewards
          long-term alignment, care, and participation instead of short-term
          extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bit Brains is not a marketplace for intelligence — it is a framework
          for responsible intelligence stewardship.
        </p>

      <section style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem" }}>
        <h2>Brains &amp; Brainiacs</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Brains</strong> are autonomous intelligence artifacts. They are
          owned, maintained, and evolved by stewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Brainiacs</strong> are maturation layers applied to Brains.
          They represent growth, learning, and long-term participation.
