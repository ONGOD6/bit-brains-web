# Proof of Care Paradigm

## Overview

Proof of Care (PoC) is a coordination and trust paradigm that measures
meaningful contribution not by raw output, capital, or speculation,
but by sustained, verifiable care over time.

Care, in this context, is defined as intentional actions that preserve,
improve, or steward a system, community, or shared resource.

## Why Proof of Care Exists

Traditional systems reward:
- Speed over thoughtfulness
- Capital over contribution
- Extraction over stewardship

Proof of Care exists to realign incentives toward:
- Long-term responsibility
- Ethical participation
- Transparent contribution

It treats care as a first-class primitive.

## Core Principles

### 1. Care Is Intentional
Care is not accidental.
It requires deliberate attention and repeated action.

### 2. Care Is Observable
Care leaves traces:
- Time invested
- Decisions made
- Resources stewarded

Proof of Care does not speculate intent — it verifies signals.

### 3. Care Compounds
Sustained care increases trust.
Trust compounds into responsibility.
Responsibility compounds into legitimacy.

## Proof, Not Performance

Proof of Care does not reward visibility or noise.
It rewards consistency.

The protocol favors:
- Quiet contributors
- Long-term stewards
- Systems thinkers

Care is proven through continuity, not spectacle.

## Human-Centered by Design

Proof of Care acknowledges human limitations:
- Attention is finite
- Burnout is real
- Incentives shape behavior

The paradigm is designed to support:
- Sustainable contribution
- Meaningful participation
- Ethical coordination

## Closing Thought

Proof of Care reframes value.

It asks not:
“What can you extract?”

But instead:
“What are you willing to care for — and for how long?”
